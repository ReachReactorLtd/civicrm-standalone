# Custom CiviCRM Extensions Directory
This directory is used to store CiviCRM extensions you install (as opposed to core CiviCRM extensions, which are in core/ext).

It must be web-accessible.

It is usually web-writeable to allow installing extensions through the UI, but it doesn't have to be if you want to manage extensions as part of your site build process.
